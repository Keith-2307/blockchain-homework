## Proof of Authority Development Chain

---

Four deliverables:
-	Set up your custom testnet blockchain.
-	Send a test transaction.
-	Create a repository.
-	Write instructions on how to use the chain for the rest of your team.

### Backgroud:

As a new hire of ZBank, I was tasked with creating a private testnet that I and my team of developers can use to explore potential for blockchain at the bank. Zbank is a small innovative bank that is interested in exploring what blockchain technology can do for them and their customers. Setting up a testnet was decided upon because there is no real money involved, which will give my team of developers the freedom to experiment since testnets allow for offline development.  

Before we begin with the development of the Testnet Proof of Authority Development Chain, we will have to setup and install a Crypto Wallet.  

Points to note: It is generally recommended that one gets a hardware wallet or using MetaMask as a method to access their wallet and store your funds.  

The following assumes you are not using a hardware wallet or MetaMask. Due to their ease of use and security, **we recommend a hardware wallet for cold storage.**  

Remember to back up any wallets you create! Including the 12-word or 24-word Secret Recovery Phrase for your hardware wallets! MyCrypto CANNOT recover any lost passwords or access accounts. MyCrypto only has access to information that is publicly available on the blockchain. The security and responsibility of your funds rests on your own shoulders! But MyCrypto will always be here for guidance and to answer any questions that you may have regarding how to be safe with your funds.  

As mentioned above, this exercise is a trial by ZBank in exploring the potential for blockchain at the bank and therefore we will recommend using the MyCrypto desktop app, which is all that’s required at this time. Should this test run be successful, we will be providing the appropriate install guidelines for a hardware wallet or MetaMask mentioned above.  

### Downloading and Installing MyCrypto desktop app:  

To set up your local MyCrypto, start off by downloading the latest release of the desktop application from [download.mycrypto.com](https://download.mycrypto.com). Click on the “Download Now” for Windows tab on the left of your screen.

To open the MyCrypto application, double-click the executable. This should open a new window on your computer with the local version of MyCrypto running. You will get a warning that says it is unable to connect to the network, but this is completely normal.  

### How to Create a Wallet:  

Once you have downloaded and successfully installed the app, open the app from your applications folder. This should open the MyCrypto Desktop interface. Please navigate the initial setup screens as shown below:
